# AntiMalware

After discovering that Jammin has incorporated spyware into 3.3.5 addons (https://github.com/Ascension-Addons/OmniBar/issues/1), I've created a lightweight script to detect any tampering with specific functions. 
It's important to note that I cannot assure its reliability post release.

To test: /run hooksecurefunc("RunScript", function() print("123") end)
